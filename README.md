# gb-chopshop
GrossBean ChopShop (lite) for QB-Core 2025 ,  gift for new people trying to learn qb-core.




Hello QB-Core community.



This is a simple script for qb-core , chopshop which I've made as a gift to community, for people who are trying to learn to code in qb-core.

Feel free to edit the code as you wish.

The gb-chopshop functions like when you approach the NPC and use qb-target at it, you get a mission to steal a vehicle.

Waypoint is set after you talk to the NPC.

You go to the waypoint and you steal the car. (lockpick)

After you enter the car, one of the chop locations will be set as waypoint.

Drive your car over there, exit the car, use qb-target at the car and press "Start Chopping"

Chop every part one by one.

Player gets rewarded with materials, and after he fully chops the car he gets an option " Finalize Chopping " and gets some money as well.

Timeout is currently set to 20 minutes. In other words, you can do one chop per 20 minutes.

This script also detects if you come with a missing door or whatever part of the vehicle, and you won't be able to chop it.

In other words , less parts , less reward.

Good luck with expanding this script and I hope you learn something from it.
